# Java Distributed System Consumers

I used Work-Queues implemantation of RabbitMQ. I created two consumer SendMail and SendEmail. When user send a message the message publish to message queue. Then at the same time the message will consume by two consumers. Thus the user will have informed from consumers and will get response.
